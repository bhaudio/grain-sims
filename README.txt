Grain Simulations: Octave simulations of granular windows and algorithms
--

These simulations were written for Octave 3.6.1, but should be generally
compatible with MATLAB/Octave style packages. They demonstrate different
algorithms that can be used for granular synthesis, and are being
developed for an Undergraduate project.
